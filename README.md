Create a web application for route planning that analyzes and compares the environmental, personal, and social impacts of different transportation modes.

1. Core Navigation Features (Building on existing functionality)
- Map interface using Leaflet.js
- Route planning with start/end points
- Avoidance areas creation
- Basic navigation features
- User location tracking

2. Transportation Modes
Primary Modes (MVP):
- Car (traditional)
- Electric car
- Motorcycle
- Scooter
- Walking
- Bicycle

Secondary Modes (Basic Support):
- Public Transit
  - Show nearby stations/stops
  - Basic schedule integration
  - Simplified connections

3. Impact Analysis System
Calculate and display impact scores (0-100 scale) for each mode:

a) Carbon Footprint Impact
- Hard-coded emissions per mile for each mode
- Route distance calculation
- Total trip emissions
- Comparative savings

b) Pain Impact Score
- Elevation changes (calculate total ascent/descent)
- Weather exposure (integrate weather API)
- Time of day factors (rush hour multipliers)
- Road type difficulty ratings
- Physical exertion estimates
- Rest point availability

c) Time Impact Score
- Base journey time
- Parking time estimates (zone-based)
- Traffic delay factors
- Time of day adjustments
- Weather impact on speed

d) Cost Impact Score
- Fuel/energy consumption
- Parking fees (zone-based)
- Vehicle wear estimates
- Public transit fares (if applicable)

e) Health Impact Score
- Caloric expenditure
- Cardiovascular benefit rating
- Air quality exposure (AirNow API integration)
- Weather condition factors

f) Social Impact Score
- Community interaction potential
- Isolation factors
- Shared transport benefits

g) Safety Impact Score
- Route type risk factors
- Time of day considerations
- Weather risk multipliers
- Traffic density impact

4. Visualization Components
- Interactive radar chart comparing all impact scores across modes
- Bar chart for carbon footprint comparison
- Timeline showing score variations by time of day
- Route overlay with color coding for impact factors
- Summary dashboard with key metrics
- Mobile-responsive design for all visualizations

5. Photo Documentation System (MVP Version)
- Basic photo upload capability
- Location tagging of photos
- User-selected categorization:
  - Road condition issues
  - Traffic concerns
  - Safety hazards
  - Environmental concerns
- Display markers on map for photo locations
- Local storage of photo data
- Simple report generation

6. Data Integration
- OpenRouteService for route calculation
- Weather API for conditions
- AirNow API for air quality data
- Elevation data from available APIs
- Hard-coded impact values for transport modes

7. User Interface Requirements
- Clean, intuitive mode selection
- Easy comparison of alternatives
- Mobile-friendly controls
- Clear impact score visualization
- Simple photo upload process
- Accessible design principles

8. Technical Requirements
- Progressive Web App capabilities
- Offline functionality for core features
- Efficient client-side calculations
- Camera API integration
- Local storage management
- Error handling for API failures

9. Data Management
- Local storage for user preferences
- Cache for frequent routes
- Photo storage optimization
- Impact calculation history

10. Future Expansion Considerations
- Structure for adding multi-modal routing
- Framework for machine learning integration
- API hooks for additional data sources
- Community feature expansion

Libraries and APIs:
- Leaflet.js for mapping
- D3.js for visualizations
- OpenRouteService API
- Weather API
- AirNow API
- HTML5 Geolocation
- Camera API

The application should prioritize:
- Clear visualization of impact comparisons
- Intuitive user experience
- Mobile-first design
- Performant calculations
- Privacy-conscious data handling
- Extensible architecture for future enhancements

Would you like me to expand on any of these sections or add additional considerations?
